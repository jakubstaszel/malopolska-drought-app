Despite the removal of clouds-covered areas during data processing, the appropriate selection of images also enhances the representativeness of the results and statistics. Attention was also paid to choosing images from a similar period within each year, with four dates selected for each year - exact dates presented in table below. Almost all data (exceptions described below the table) were acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellites within relative orbit number 036, utilizing measurements from both satellites."
